First step in setting up like above multi environmental architecture is to create an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com)
with your credit/debit card.

## Organizational unit

- Navigate to [AWS Organizations](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/home)
- Under `Organize accounts` tab, Create a `New organizational unit` with name `codetaut`
- Under `Policies` tab, click `Enable` to enable [Service control policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html).
- Click `Service control policies`, and then click `Create Policy`
- Give policy name **OrganizationalServicePolicies** and description **Policy that describes AWS service access across organisation**
- Under policy document editor section provide the below policy and create policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAll",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ExplicitlyDeny",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": ["ec2:*", "elasticache:*", "es:*", "rds:*", "mobilehub:*", "devicefarm:*"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

<div className="gutter-top alert alert-primary">
  The above policy explicitly denies access to listed services under `Action` array across the
  organization. This is a strategic decision to avoid high cost consuming services in AWS.
</div>

- From the list of SCPs, select the above created **OrganizationalServicePolicies**, and attach Organizational units created above
  i.e `codetaut`

### Account

- Leave the _IAM role name_ empty
- Click _Create_, and new account will added to other root organization `codetaut`
- An email should have received in your mail box, then proceed with _Access Account_
- For first time sign in, choose forgot password and reset it
- After this you will be able successfully login to the console for `codetaut-tst` account

<div className="gutter-top alert alert-primary">
  After login to console navigate to{' '}
  <a className="underline" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home">
    IAM
  </a>{' '}
  and customize the sign-in link by providing account alias `codetaut-tst`
</div>

- Add this account to the organizational unit `codetaut`
- Create an SCP with _Policy name_ as **TstAccountAccessPolicy** and _Description_ as **Policy for tst account access**
- Under policy document editor section provide the below policy and create policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",

    {
      "Sid": "ServicesToAllowInDev",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "NotAction": [
        "cloudformation:*",
        "cloudwatch:*",
        "logs:*",
        "dynamodb:*",
        "ecs:*",
        "iam:*",
        "kms:*",
        "lambda:*",
        "sts:*",
        "events:*",
        "cognito-identity:*",
        "cognito-sync:*",
        "cognito-idp:*",
        "tag:*",
        "s3:*",
        "codebuild:*",
        "codepipeline:*",
        "secretsmanager:*",
        "states:*",
        "ssm:*",
        "apigateway:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

<div className="gutter-top alert alert-primary">
  The above policy explicitly allow access to **ONLY** listed services under `Action` array.
</div>

- Select the newly created policy and attach to `codetaut-tst` account

<div className="gutter-top alert alert-primary">

  organization, i.e `codetaut-sbx`, `codetaut-dev`, `codetaut-prd`
</div>
